# CAB_Algorithm
Implemented the "Continuum Armbed Bandit" algorithm given in the publication "On Two Continuum Armed Bandit Problems in High Dimensions". For playing arms, it uses the UCB1 algorithm as described in the text "Finite-time Analysis of the Multiarmed Bandit Problem".

# TO DO:
Use matplotlib to display the "Regret vs Time".
